Return on Equity (ROE) Decomposition: ROE data is not available for COST.\n   - Profit Margin: 2.60%\n   - Equity Multiplier: None\n   This breakdown shows that Apple's high ROE is primarily driven by its strong profit margins rather than aggressive leverage or asset utilization.\n\n3. R&D Efficiency: COST invests 0.0 of its revenue in R&D. This level of investment is crucial for maintaining its innovative edge in the tech industry while still maintaining high profit margins.\n\n5. Market Dominance: With a revenue of $242.29 billion, COST demonstrates its commanding position in the tech industry.
